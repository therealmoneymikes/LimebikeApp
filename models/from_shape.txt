What it does:

Takes a Shapely geometry object (e.g., Point, Polygon, LineString)

Converts it into a WKBElement object that SQLAlchemy/GeoAlchemy2 understands

This WKBElement can be directly assigned to a Geography or Geometry column in your SQLAlchemy model

ðŸ”‘ Why do we need it?

PostGIS columns (Geography, Geometry) donâ€™t accept plain tuples or Shapely objects.
They expect something serializable to PostGIS formats (WKB or WKT).

Shapely â†’ Python library for geometry objects (in memory).

from_shape â†’ bridges Shapely â†” GeoAlchemy2 â†” PostGIS.

It wraps your Shapely geometry into the type that SQLAlchemy can insert into the DB.
