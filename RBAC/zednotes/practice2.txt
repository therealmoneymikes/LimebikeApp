In SpiceDB, + means union (OR). view = reader OR owner
If any of the conditions are true, the permission is granted.
permission view = reader + owner



2. The -> arrow
The arrow lets you “walk” relationships into another object’s permissions or relations.

The arrow lets you “walk” relationships into another object’s permissions or relations.

relation parent: folder
permission view = reader + parent->owner

A document has a parent folder.

If the user is an owner of that parent folder, then they can also view the document.

"Follow the parent link, and check if the user is in owner of that parent."

So -> = traverse from this resource to another resource’s relation/permission.


3. Recursive permissions

This one is a bit trickier.
Recursive = a permission that refers to itself, often through another resource.

definition folder {
    relation owner: user
    relation parent: folder

    permission view = owner + parent->view
}

A folder can be viewed if:

You’re an owner of that folder, OR

You can view its parent.
That means if you have view on a top-level folder, you automatically get view on all subfolders.







definition document {
    relation parent: folder
    permission view = parent->view
}

→ If you can view the top folder, you can view all nested folders and all documents inside them, no matter how deep.

That’s the recursive effect: permissions “cascade down” a hierarchy.
