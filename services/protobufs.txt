Key changes made:

Removed manual gRPC setup - The authzed client handles all channel and credential management
Updated method signatures - Added resource_type parameter since you likely work with multiple resource types (bikes, pickup_points, etc.)
Added new helpful methods:

remove_role() - Remove a relationship
get_user_resources() - Find all resources a user can access
get_resource_users() - Find all users who can access a resource
read_relationships() - Query relationships with filters
